# 3D-Graphics-Engine
3D Graphics Engine created using Python.
Just download the python file and run! 

You can also define your own 3D object in the source code. Each object in 3D space is defined by a collection of 2D triangles in 3D space.

Then the program will display your object rotating in 3D space.
