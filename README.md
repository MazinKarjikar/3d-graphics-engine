# 3D Graphics Engine
3D Graphics Engine created using Python.
Just download the python file and run! 

You can also define your own 3D object in the source code. Each object in 3D space is defined by a collection of 2D triangles in 3D space. Just replace the cube's triangulation with the triangulation that defines your desired object.

Then the program will display your object rotating in 3D space.

By default the program displays a spinning cube in 3D space! But it will work with any 3D object.
